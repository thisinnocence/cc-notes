# C/C++ notes

Notes on C/C++-related topics, including blog posts, personal notes, and corresponding code implementations.

For C++, a `cpp-book` directory has been added, primarily based on the following resources:

- [Modern C++ Tutorial (GitHub)](https://github.com/changkun/modern-cpp-tutorial)  
- [Modern C++ Tutorial (Website)](https://changkun.de/modern-cpp/zh-cn/00-preface)

This setup makes it easier to document and reference key concepts.
